    <h2>Who was Alan Turing?</h2>
    <p1>Amongst the many computer scientist who lived long before us, there is one who was special in particular, and deserves a tribute to.<br>
    That man is Alan Turing. Now he might be an unfamiliar name, and many would wonder, who was Alan Turing? Alan Turing was once<br> an mathematician,
    computer scientist, logician, cryptanalyst, philosopher, and theoretical biologist.
    He was originally famous for developing<br> the idea of a modern computer, and how it should function. He was also known for inventing the idea of
    artificial intelligence alongside a certain<br> John McCarthy, but Alan would soon die before he could see the first AI program which came out in 1956.
    During World War II, he was tasked<br> with breaking the enigma code of the Nazi radio signals, which he accomplished.
    Under the words of Winston Churchill, Turing shortened the<br> war by a possible 2 years.</p1>
    <h3>The life of a computer genius</h3>

    <p>Alan Turing was born in a small city in England named Maida Vale, London on June 23, 1912. Alan's father was Julius Turing, and his mother was Sara Ethel Turing.<br>
    During the time of Alan's birth, his father was on leave from his position at the ICS (Indian Civil Service). When Turing was young, he was
    immediately recognized of his talent from his teachers when<br> he was enrolled in St.Michael's elementary school. From there, he moved to the
    Sherborne public school. When Turing was 16, he would continue to solve extremely advanced problems without even having the basic knowledge of
    calculus. <br>Despite Turing's remarkable abilities to solve advanced problems, he did not gain any respect from his teachers or peers for the reason
    that, he wouldn't solve the basic questions that his grade would learn.
    When he graduated from Sherborne, Alan would<br> move on to King's College in Cambridge. When he was 22
    he would be awarded with the first-class honours in mathematics and would later prove the central limit theorem. From then, Turing would switch to the more
    prestigous Princeton University, where he would <br>continue to study cryptology and receive his PhD in the departement of mathematics. On september 4, 1939 when Great Britain would
    declare war on Germany, Turing was tasked with breaking the Nazi encrypted messages to tap into german communication lines, <br>making the job of the military much easier.
    After the war, he would continue to make many important contributions to the computing world which will be mentioned in the next paragraph. Although Turing had made many contributions to mankind
    with his discoveries and theorems,<br> he would still be discriminated by people, and faced charges for being a homosexual man, since back then in Britain, it was illegal for people to be homosexual.
    Unfortunately, Turing would later be convicted of having sexual relations with a man. Despite not facing any jail time,<br> he would still commit suicide from the judgement of society. He later
    commited suicide by eating an apple laced with cyanide. He would be found dead in his bed on June 23, 1954 by a maid with an half eaten apple on his nightstand. On June 23, 2001, a statue
    would be built to commemorate<br> the day Alan Turing died, and honour the wrongful discrimination against him.</p>

    <h3><b>Accomplishments and contributions</b></h3>
    During the life of Alan Turing, he had accomplished and contributed many things that many people couldn't do. Here is a table with a timeline of every important accomplishment/contribution that Alan Turing had made.


  <table>
  <tr>
    <th>1936</th>
    <th>Turing publishes his first seminal paper called "On Computable Numbers, with an Application to the Entscheidungsproblem - Decision Problem"
    which contains theories on what modern computer science is based on today. This would ultimately be called the "Turing machine".
    The paper would display the concepts of a machine capable of solving any problem, as long as the problem could be described in simple instructions which
    were encoded on some sort of technology, a.k.a artificial intelligence. This would be the first time the idea would be introduced in history but the idea
    would only be imaginary for the time being.</th>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>1939-1940</td>
    <td>When Great Britain declared war on Germany in 1939, Alan had just joined the government and cypher code school in the summer of 1938. In autumn of 1939,
    Turing and his team would create a code-breaking machine called "the bomba." This machine was able to decipher the sophisticated german enigma code, and give intel to
    the military. They were able to decipher more than 84,000 messages per month. This helped the British military a lot and according to Winston Churchill, he shortened
    the war by an extra 2 years and possibly saved the lives of 2 million people.</td>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>1945</td>
    <td>When the war was finally over, Turing was recruited to the NPL (National Physical Laboratory) where he would create one of the first electronic, automatic computing
    engine that was able to store all purpose, digital data. He would later write the first programming manual for the first marketable electronic digital computer in 1951. </td>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>1951-1953</td>
    <td>These times would be the most difficult for Turing as he was convicted of "gross indecency." Nonetheless, Turing would work on his idea of artificial intelligence.
    He would describe this idea as a computer, running a program to trick a questioner about its true identity, not knowing which one was a human and which was a computer.
    Unfortunately, Turing would not be able to see his idea come to life, as he died in 1954.</td>
